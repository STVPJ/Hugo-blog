[{"content":"By Mik Kersten | Summary by STVPJ\nAs we charge into the digital era, the rules of business are rapidly changing. Companies that once dominated their industries are finding themselves outpaced by nimble startups and tech giants who‚Äôve mastered the art of software delivery. In his groundbreaking book, Project to Product, Mik Kersten reveals why traditional project-based management models are failing and offers a new framework‚Äîthe Flow Framework‚Äîto help organizations survive and thrive in the Age of Software.\nüìâ The Premise: Why the Project Model is Obsolete Kersten opens the book with a compelling argument: the project-based structures that powered businesses through the Age of Mass Production are no longer fit for today‚Äôs software-driven world. Instead of treating software delivery as a series of finite, scope-bound projects, companies must adopt a product mindset‚Äîfocusing on long-term value streams and continuous delivery.\n\u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re managing software like we\u0026rsquo;re still building bridges.\u0026rdquo; ‚Äî Mik Kersten\nThe old model, built for predictability and control, stifles innovation. It creates silos, breaks accountability, and fails to account for the non-linear, iterative nature of modern software development.\nüîÑ The Flow Framework: A New Way to Think About Work At the core of the book is the Flow Framework, Kersten‚Äôs blueprint for transforming how organizations manage software delivery. It introduces four types of work items that flow through software value streams:\nFeatures ‚Äì User-driven enhancements Defects ‚Äì Quality issues Risks ‚Äì Security, compliance, or other risk-related work Debts ‚Äì Technical or infrastructure improvements These ‚ÄúFlow Items‚Äù are the units of measurement in the Flow Framework. Organizations then track Flow Metrics like:\nFlow Velocity Flow Efficiency Flow Time Flow Load The ultimate goal? Aligning IT with business outcomes in a measurable, real-time way.\n‚öôÔ∏è The Age of Software and the Turning Point Kersten situates this shift in the broader context of Carlota Perez‚Äôs theory of technological revolutions. We are now entering the Deployment Period of the Age of Software‚Äîthe point where companies must either adapt to software-driven ways of working or fade into irrelevance.\nCompanies like Nokia failed, not because they didn‚Äôt try to adapt, but because they measured success with flawed metrics‚Äîlike Agile adoption rates‚Äîrather than true value delivery.\nüß≠ Value Streams: The Heart of the Product Model Kersten urges organizations to orient around value streams, not departments or projects. A value stream represents the end-to-end activities required to deliver value to the customer. Rather than shifting people between projects, companies should:\nFund long-lived product teams, not one-off projects Track flow, not just budget and timeline Integrate tooling into a seamless Value Stream Network üìö Case Studies and Epiphanies Throughout the book, Kersten shares stories of transformation‚Äîboth failed and successful. He reflects on lessons from:\nThe BMW Leipzig plant (a marvel of lean production) Nokia‚Äôs Agile rollout A global bank‚Äôs $1B transformation gone sideways He outlines three epiphanies from his journey:\nArchitecture must align to value stream, not the reverse Disconnected toolchains destroy productivity Software is not a pipeline‚Äîit‚Äôs a collaborative network üí• Why Most Digital Transformations Fail Many organizations fail despite well-funded Agile/DevOps efforts. Kersten identifies three core issues:\nFocus on activities (e.g., Agile training), not outcomes Lack of business‚ÄìIT alignment Inability to see or measure value flow The solution is not more tooling or process frameworks‚Äîit‚Äôs a shift in mindset and management logic.\nüöÄ Beyond the Turning Point Kersten finishes with a clear call to action. The Age of Software is here, and those who fail to adapt risk becoming obsolete. But those who embrace product thinking and build connected Value Stream Networks will:\nDeliver better customer outcomes Make smarter investments Attract and retain top talent Regain competitive advantage üß† TL;DR: Key Takeaways The project model is broken for modern software delivery. The Flow Framework replaces it with measurable, value-centric metrics. Shift focus from projects to products and value streams. Digital transformation fails without visibility into Flow. The Age of Software demands a new management paradigm. Inspired by Mik Kersten‚Äôs Project to Product.

Or so it seems.\nWalk into nearly any modern software organization and you‚Äôll be told they ‚Äúdo agile.‚Äù There are stand-ups. Sprints. Story points. Jira boards. Retros. There\u0026rsquo;s probably a release train or two. On paper, it looks like agility. But in reality, it\u0026rsquo;s anything but.\nDespite widespread adoption of agile methodologies and frameworks, most companies still fail to embody what agile truly stands for. What we‚Äôre seeing isn‚Äôt agile‚Äîit‚Äôs agile theater. A performance of rituals devoid of the mindset and principles that actually make agile work.\nWhy? Because no one wants to talk about the real reason agile fails in big organizations:\nTrue agility means you won‚Äôt know exactly how long something will take, or how much it will cost, before you begin.\nThat‚Äôs the uncomfortable truth. And it\u0026rsquo;s the one truth that almost no one in a boardroom wants to hear.\nThe Illusion of Predictability Let‚Äôs be clear: agile is not a framework. It‚Äôs a mindset.\nWhen the Agile Manifesto was written, it was a response to the rigidity of traditional software development‚Äîa world in which long-term plans rarely survived contact with reality. Agile promised something better: flexibility, collaboration, and continuous delivery of value.\nBut large organizations have tried to retrofit agile into the very structures it was meant to replace. They‚Äôve imposed predictability on top of adaptability. They\u0026rsquo;ve institutionalized delivery cadences and backlogs and roadmaps and burndown charts in an effort to make agile feel safe and familiar. In doing so, they\u0026rsquo;ve fundamentally undermined it.\nFrameworks like SAFe and LeSS may offer a sense of control at scale, but they often do so by compromising on the core agile principle: embrace uncertainty.\nBecause at the heart of true agility is a simple reality: you are building something new, and you cannot plan certainty into discovery.\nWhy Agile Needs Uncertainty The Agile Manifesto begins with individuals and interactions over processes and tools. It emphasizes working software over comprehensive documentation. It encourages customer collaboration over contract negotiation. And above all, it values responding to change over following a plan.\nThese are not project management practices. These are philosophical commitments.\nAnd if you take them seriously, then it follows that:\nYou cannot guarantee fixed scopes, timelines, or budgets up front. You will learn things mid-flight that will force you to change direction. You must give teams the autonomy to solve problems in ways that aren\u0026rsquo;t fully spec‚Äôd before they begin. This is what makes agile work‚Äîand what makes it so uncomfortable for command-and-control management styles.\nVelocity Is Not Value In the absence of real agility, organizations default to what they can measure. And the easiest thing to measure is velocity‚Äîhow many story points a team completes per sprint. But velocity is a local optimization. It tells you how busy your team is, not how effective they are.\nVelocity is about output. Agile is about outcomes.\nYou can double your team‚Äôs velocity and still build something no one wants. You can hit every sprint goal and still miss the market. You can have high throughput and zero impact.\nThis is where most agile transformations break down: they prioritize activity over value.\nSo, What Should We Measure? If agile is about delivering value, then value must be what we measure.\nBut value isn‚Äôt a simple thing. It‚Äôs not a number you pull out of Jira. It‚Äôs not a burndown chart or a feature count.\nValue is what helps your organization succeed.\nIt shows up in:\nIncreased revenue Reduced customer churn Improved user satisfaction Greater market share Stronger engagement or retention These are lagging indicators of success‚Äîthey tell you after the fact whether what you built actually made a difference. But because they lag, they‚Äôre not always useful for day-to-day decision-making.\nThat‚Äôs where proxy metrics come in.\nProxy Metrics: Aligning Toward Impact To make agile actionable in the short term, teams need leading indicators that signal whether they‚Äôre moving in the right direction.\nEngineering teams focus on delivery health:\nCycle time Deployment frequency Lead time for changes Change failure rate These help identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and delivery risks. They don‚Äôt measure value directly‚Äîbut they indicate how reliably the team can deliver value when it‚Äôs found.\nProduct teams focus on signals of product-market fit:\nActivation rates Feature adoption Retention curves Customer satisfaction scores Net Promoter Scores (NPS) Task success rates These help gauge whether users are finding what‚Äôs being built useful and valuable.\nThe real power comes from aligning these two sets of indicators: ensuring that delivery teams are enabled to move fast and safely, while product teams are focused on the highest-leverage problems.\nEfficiency vs. Effectiveness: Know the Difference Here‚Äôs the critical distinction that many agile teams blur:\nDelivery teams should be optimized for efficiency‚Äîto execute with speed, quality, and stability. Product teams should be optimized for effectiveness‚Äîto ensure that what gets delivered actually matters. If you optimize only for speed, you risk building the wrong thing faster.\nIf you optimize only for insight, you risk discovering great opportunities too slowly.\nAgile is about continuously improving both sides of that equation.\nThat means:\nCreating a clear separation of concerns between prioritization and execution. Funding and structuring teams around outcomes, not projects. Giving product and delivery teams joint ownership of goals, but distinct accountability for what gets done and how it gets done. Agility Without Illusions The real tragedy of faux-agile is that it gives organizations the illusion of adaptability without requiring any of the discipline or humility that true agility demands.\nAgile is not about adopting a framework. It‚Äôs about cultivating a mindset:\nOne that values learning over knowing. One that embraces change over control. One that prioritizes customer outcomes over internal process fidelity. When you strip away the jargon, the tickets, and the tooling, this is the real work:\n‚Üí Helping organizations get comfortable with uncertainty.\n‚Üí Focusing teams on value, not velocity.\n‚Üí And measuring success not by how much you deliver‚Äîbut by how much it matters.\nFinal Thought If your agile process gives you the illusion of predictability but none of the adaptability, it‚Äôs not agile. It‚Äôs a fa√ßade.\nAnd if your stakeholders expect certainty in timelines and cost before any real discovery has happened, they‚Äôre not signing up for agile‚Äîthey‚Äôre asking for waterfall with daily standups.\nThe question isn‚Äôt ‚Äúare we agile?‚Äù\nThe real question is: do we have the courage to let go of control in pursuit of value?\n","date":"2025-04-20T09:00:00Z","image":"https://stvpj.com/p/agile-pitfalls-measuring-value/header_hu_9a1a6c31c0b92920.png","permalink":"https://stvpj.com/p/agile-pitfalls-measuring-value/","title":"Agile Isn‚Äôt What You Think"},{"content":"Why Product Managers Should Trust Their Gut When Data Falls Short As Product Managers, we‚Äôre often told to ‚Äúlet the data speak‚Äù and to rely on hard evidence to validate our hypotheses. And rightly so‚Äîdata is a powerful tool for minimizing risk and understanding user behavior. However, there‚Äôs a vital piece of the product innovation puzzle that is often overlooked: intuition. When the right data isn‚Äôt available or doesn‚Äôt exist, your gut can be your most valuable ally.\nIn fact, some of the most transformative innovations we celebrate today were born in moments when data was either nonexistent or irrelevant. Let‚Äôs explore why Product Managers shouldn‚Äôt shy away from trusting their instincts when navigating uncharted waters.\nData Is a Compass, Not a Crystal Ball Marty Cagan, author of Inspired, emphasizes the limitations of relying solely on data. He writes, ‚ÄúData is essential, but it only tells you about the past. If you want to invent the future, you have to look beyond the data.‚Äù Data can show us what has worked before, but it rarely points to what will work in the future, especially when you‚Äôre venturing into unexplored territory.\nWhen a Product Manager tries to innovate in a space that‚Äôs new or undefined, historical data often falls short. Imagine being the first to propose something like the iPhone. What data would have validated that hypothesis? None. Yet, Steve Jobs famously said, ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt know what they want until you show it to them.‚Äù\nVisionary Thinking Often Precedes Data Some of the most game-changing innovations weren‚Äôt built on data‚Äîthey were built on a deep understanding of human needs and the courage to make bold decisions. Steve Jobs‚Äô intuition about user experience led to products that redefined industries. Had Apple waited for market research to prove demand, the iPhone might never have happened.\nSimilarly, Pawel Huryn, product leader and author, argues that ‚Äúgreat product managers are great storytellers‚Äîthey imagine a better world and then find a way to make it real.‚Äù In the early stages of product development, storytelling and vision often fill the gaps where data cannot.\nWhen to Trust Your Gut Trusting your gut doesn‚Äôt mean ignoring data‚Äîit means knowing when it isn‚Äôt enough. Here are some scenarios where intuition can be invaluable:\nWhen entering uncharted markets: No historical data exists for truly innovative ideas. When experimenting with new paradigms: Early-stage products often lack the metrics to guide decisions. When responding to qualitative insights: User interviews and anecdotal evidence sometimes reveal truths that numbers can‚Äôt. Pawel Huryn puts it succinctly: ‚ÄúYour gut feeling is your subconscious mind processing years of experience, knowledge, and observations. It‚Äôs not irrational; it‚Äôs informed.‚Äù\nBalancing Data and Intuition The key is to strike a balance. Use data when it‚Äôs available and relevant, but don‚Äôt let the absence of perfect data paralyze you. Great Product Managers are not just analysts‚Äîthey‚Äôre visionaries who can navigate ambiguity and take calculated risks.\nAs Marty Cagan reminds us, ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, your job is to solve problems in a way that creates value for your customers and your company. Don‚Äôt let data become an excuse for inaction.‚Äù\n","date":"2025-04-20T09:08:36+01:00","image":"https://stvpj.com/p/why-product-managers-should-trust-their-gut-when-data-falls-short/header_hu_7e564e58ecc7b1fd.png","permalink":"https://stvpj.com/p/why-product-managers-should-trust-their-gut-when-data-falls-short/","title":"Why Product Managers Should Trust Their Gut When Data Falls Short"},{"content":"Enhancing User Experience through Security and Data Governance: A Product Manager\u0026rsquo;s Perspective\nWe live in an age where our personal information is increasingly digitised. Every click, every search, and every online purchase leaves behind a digital footprint. As a Product Manager, my main goal is not just to deliver feature-rich applications but to ensure that these applications are safe, trustworthy, and provide an excellent user experience. One might assume that optimising for security and data governance might hinder the user experience. Contrary to that belief, I\u0026rsquo;m here to argue that enhancing security and data governance is, in fact, a significant booster to the overall user experience.\nBuilding Trust\nThe most apparent benefit of security optimisation is trust. When users realise that a product or service prioritises their security, they are more likely to trust it. Trust, in the digital realm, is not just a nice-to-have; it\u0026rsquo;s a necessity. A product that loses its users\u0026rsquo; trust might as well lose its users.\nSmooth Experience with Fewer Interruptions\nImagine a scenario where an application gets compromised. This would lead to downtimes, emergency maintenance, or even data breaches. Each of these outcomes disrupts the user experience. By investing in security from the get-go, we ensure a seamless experience for our users, free from unexpected disruptions.\nEmpowerment through Transparency\nData governance isn\u0026rsquo;t just about keeping user data safe; it\u0026rsquo;s about being transparent about how this data is used. By giving users a clear insight into what data is collected, why it\u0026rsquo;s collected, and how it\u0026rsquo;s used, we empower them. An empowered user is an engaged user, and an engaged user is the key to enhanced user experience.\nTailored User Experiences without the Creepiness\nOne of the main reasons companies collect data is to provide a more tailored experience to their users. However, there\u0026rsquo;s a fine line between personalisation and intrusiveness. Proper data governance ensures that personalisation is done right, without crossing the boundaries of user comfort.\nCompliance Equals Access\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s global market, regulatory compliance is not optional. Regulations like GDPR in Europe or CCPA in California have strict requirements regarding data privacy and security. By adhering to these regulations, we not only avoid hefty fines but ensure that our product is accessible to a broader audience without regional restrictions.\nFuture-proofing the Business\nSecurity threats and data misuse are not static; they evolve. By building a foundation based on robust security and data governance, we are preparing our product for the challenges of the future. This ensures that our users continue to have a consistent and safe experience even as digital landscapes change.\nUser Feedback and Continuous Improvement\nWhen users feel safe and trust a platform, they are more likely to provide genuine feedback. This feedback is invaluable. It allows us to continuously refine and improve, ensuring the user experience keeps getting better.\nIn conclusion, security and data governance are not mere checkboxes in the product development process. They are crucial pillars that hold the weight of user trust and engagement. By integrating them into the core of our products, we are not sacrificing user experience; we are elevating it.\nRemember, in the end, it\u0026rsquo;s not just about building a product; it\u0026rsquo;s about building a relationship with our users. And like any successful relationship, it must be built on trust, transparency, and mutual respect.\n","date":"2025-04-19T14:30:00Z","image":"https://stvpj.com/p/how-security-and-data-governance-improve-user-experience/header_hu_5ff8f9455dcfecd0.png","permalink":"https://stvpj.com/p/how-security-and-data-governance-improve-user-experience/","title":"How Security and Data Governance Improve User Experience"},{"content":"Lean Thinking: What It Is‚Äîand What It Isn‚Äôt Lean is one of the most misunderstood concepts in modern business. It‚Äôs often mistaken for a buzzword, a quick-fix method, or worse‚Äîjust another cost-cutting exercise.\nLet‚Äôs start by setting the record straight.\nLean is not:\nA miracle cure for all business problems A synonym for ‚Äúdoing more with less‚Äù at any cost A new religion, fad, or acronym Lean is a long-term, strategic approach to improving how organizations work‚Äîone that puts customer value at the centre and treats anything that doesn‚Äôt contribute to that value (or the safety, quality, and stability of the organization) as waste.\nLean is a philosophy of continuous improvement that eliminates waste, empowers people, and focuses relentlessly on delivering value to customers.\nThe Three Pillars of Lean All credible definitions of Lean align around three core goals:\nDeliver better value to customers Do more with less Ensure quality and long-term sustainability are never compromised Organizations that embrace Lean behave in consistent, observable ways:\nEveryone understands what customers truly value Continuous improvement is part of daily operations Respect for people is central The organization aligns long-term thinking with short-term actions Lean becomes part of the culture‚Äînot just a program The Toyota Way: 14 Principles of Lean Excellence Jeffrey Liker‚Äôs The Toyota Way breaks Lean into 14 principles, grouped into four themes:\n1. Philosophy as a Foundation 1. Make decisions based on long-term thinking, not short-term gains. 2. The Right Process Produces the Right Results 2. Create continuous flow to surface problems 3. Use pull systems to avoid overproduction 4. Level out workloads (heijunka) 5. Stop to fix problems and get quality right the first time 6. Standardize tasks as the basis for improvement and empowerment 7. Use visual controls so no problems stay hidden 8. Use only reliable, thoroughly tested technology that supports people 3. Add Value by Developing People and Partners 9. Grow leaders who understand and teach the philosophy 10. Build great teams that align with company goals 11. Respect partners and suppliers‚Äîhelp them improve too 4. Continuous Problem Solving Drives Learning 12. Go see for yourself (genchi genbutsu) to understand situations 13. Make decisions slowly by consensus, implement them quickly 14. Become a learning organization through reflection and improvement The 8 Wastes of Lean Lean identifies 8 common forms of waste, present in both manufacturing and service sectors:\nWaiting ‚Äì Delays between process steps Overproduction ‚Äì Doing more than needed Rework ‚Äì Fixing mistakes or defects Motion ‚Äì Unnecessary movement of people Transport ‚Äì Unneeded movement of materials or information Processing ‚Äì Extra work that doesn‚Äôt add value Inventory ‚Äì Excess stock or queued activity Talent ‚Äì Underusing people\u0026rsquo;s skills and creativity Final Thoughts: Lean as a Culture, Not a Checklist Lean is not a toolset. It‚Äôs a mindset.\nIt‚Äôs not a one-time transformation‚Äîit‚Äôs a way of thinking.\nIt asks us to:\nEmpower people Eliminate waste Pursue purpose Continuously improve It‚Äôs hard work. But for organizations willing to commit, Lean offers a path to more meaningful value, healthier teams, and resilient long-term success.\n","date":"2025-04-19T09:00:00Z","image":"https://stvpj.com/p/what-lean-really-means/header_hu_af7610b0b62360a3.png","permalink":"https://stvpj.com/p/what-lean-really-means/","title":"What Lean Really Means"}]
